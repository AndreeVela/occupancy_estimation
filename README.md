Experimental data used for multiclass classification (room occupancy) from Temperature, Relative Humidity, and Barometric Pressure. Ground-truth occupancy was obtained in two ways: 1) from a subjective observation, and 2) from time stamped pictures that were taken every 10 minutes. The data includes:

- Orignial Measurements in a 1 sec resolution for the Fitness Gym and the Living Room. 
- Train and test splits for each of the monitored spaces in the following resolutions: 10 sec, 10 sec avg, 30 sec, 30 sec avg, 1 min, 1 min avg, 5 min, 5 min avg.
- Datasets with extra features for feature selection.
